                        </div>
                        <p>Haripada Bhattacharyya (1915 - ?), son of Ambika Bhattacharyya, was born in Popdia, a tiny
                            village of the Boalkhali subdivision of Chittagong of the undivided Bengal. Born in a poor
                            family of a teacher in the elementary Sanskrit school (Tol), he could not afford to go to
                            school and had his basic education at home.<br><br>

                            Haripada was the youngest follower of Surya Sen, the hero of the Chittagong Uprising, who
                            did not let him join since he was only fourteen years old at the time.<br><br>

                            For Haripada, the opportunity came on 30 August 1930 at the Chittagong football ground, when
                            at the end of a match Khan Bahadur Asanulla Khan, a police inspector was waving the shield
                            from the dais due to the victory of his team. A notorious police officer, Mr. Khan was on
                            the hit list of revolutionaries for a long time. Harihada seized this opportunity; getting
                            closer to the dais he shot at Mr. Khan and killed him; nobody suspected him that a boy of
                            his stature could do this.<br><br>

                            Seized by the crowd, he was mercilessly beaten and paraded through the streets, profusely
                            bleeding. His parents were tied to the tree and tortured till they were in their senses;
                            their huts were drenched with kerosene and were put on fire. In the trial, he was spared the
                            death sentence in consideration of his age but was transmigrated for life to the Cellular
                            Jail.</p>

                        <p>A great revolutionary who spent twenty years of his life in a British prison, Nikhilranjan
                            Guharoy(1888-1974) was born in the Faridpur district of undivided Bengal. Nothing is known
                            about the village he was born in, his parentage, early life, education, and his political
                            association.<br><br>

                            His name surfaced in the Nadia-Shibpur dacoity case, which is important in the annals of the
                            Swadeshi dacoity for two reasons: the risk involved in the enterprise compared to its yield;
                            and the imprisonment of a large number of revolutionaries. For the revolutionaries, dacoity
                            was the only means to mobilize funds they needed to buy arms and ammunition.<br><br>

                            On 30 September 1915, a group of 25 revolutionaries armed with German Mauser pistols
                            attacked Krishnapada Biswas’s house at the midnight, a rich merchant in Shibpur village of
                            the Kotwali police station in Nadia. On their return journey in the boat, they opened fire
                            at the crowd chasing them which killed three people.<br><br>

                            Later, Nikhilranjan along with fifteen others was arrested and transmigrated for life. His
                            co-prisoners in Cellular Jail included Barindrakumar Ghosh, Upendranath Bandyopadhyay,
                            Ullaskar Datta, and Veer Savarkar. He was released along with other convicts during the
                            First World War; only to be sent back to the Cellular Jail again in the Kandi Bomb Case in
                            1930 till his final release in 1946.</p>

                        <p>A truly unsung hero, Sunil Kumar Chatterjee’s life is shrouded in obscurity. Nothing is known
                            about his parentage, birthplace, early education or political association. In 1932, he
                            surfaced in Calcutta in the revolutionary association.<br><br>

                            The early 1930s was a decade of sustained revolutionary activities in Bengal reaching its
                            peak with the Chittagong Uprising, which crippled the British administration in the city for
                            a couple of days. The Calcutta-based English newspaper, the Statesman, then edited by Mr.
                            Alfred Watson, was highly critical of the Indian nationalist movement. Mr. Watson’s
                            sustained campaign against them and advocacy of harsh punishment made him a target of the
                            Bengal revolutionaries. In his editorial column, he observed that all these revolutionaries
                            should be taken out of jails and hung on the lampposts of the city.<br><br>

                            On 5 August 1932, revolutionary Atul Sen of Khulna attacked him in the broad daylight in
                            Calcutta with a revolver and bombs; but he survived unhurt, while Atul Sen consumed poison
                            to avoid arrest. A more concerted attack followed two months later under Mani Lahiri. On 28
                            September, driving an open-hooted car, Mani Lahiri, Anil Bhaduri, Sunil Chatterjee, and
                            Biren Roy blocked Mr. Watson’s car on his way home, shot him, and also charged bombs leaving
                            him incapacitated for life.<br><br>

                            In a hurry, they met with an accident on the Majerhat Bridge; profusely bleeding Mani and
                            Anil consumed potassium cyanides to avoid arrest; Brien Roy escaped, while Sunil Chatterjee
                            was arrested. In the trial, he was sentenced to transportation for life; released in 1946
                            under a general amnesty.</p>

                        <p>
                            Martyred at the age of twenty-two years, Pramodranjan(1904-1926) was the son of Ishanchandra
                            Chaudhuri, Zamindar of Kelishahar in Chittagong of the undivided Bengal. Nothing is known
                            about his early education. Inspired by Charubikash Datta, he joined the Chittagong unit of
                            the Aunshilan Samiti as a student in 1920; and then shifted to Surya Sen’s group.<br><br>

                            Chittagong revolutionaries had a shelter at 4 Shovabazar Street, Calcutta with its link to
                            the All-Bengal Revolutionary Party hideout at Bachaspatipara Lane, Dakshineshwar in
                            24-Parganas. In a late-night swoop at these places (10 November 1925), police arrested
                            Pramodranjan, Anantahari Mitra, and others from Dakshineshwar, with a huge cache of a
                            revolver, ammunitions, bomb-making ingredients, and unlawful documents; In the trial, they
                            were sentenced to five years rigorous imprisonment.<br><br>

                            Inside the Alipore Jail, they killed Bhupendranath Chatterjee with an iron rod. A Deputy
                            Super in the intelligence branch of police, Bhupendranath met the inmates in the jail and
                            tried to get information from them. The revolutionaries thus decided to eliminate him. Five
                            prisoners claimed responsibilities at a time; police, having failed to fix the culprit,
                            arrested all of them. In the ensuing trial, Pramodranjan and Anantahari Mitra were sentenced
                            to death; the order was executed on 28 September 1926 in the Alipore Central Jail.

                            Somnath Bira was born in a Kashmiri Pandit family of Rainawari in Srinagar. He was a
                            postgraduate in History from Lahore University and did his research on the topic “ Kashmir
                            in the Eyes of Foreign Travellers”. P.N.Jalali, M.L.Misri, Peer Ghiyasuddin, N.N. Rai, and
                            O.N.Trisal, etc some of the famous personalities of the time were his batchmates. Somnath
                            Bira was associated with Sheikh Abdullah and was an active member of the National
                            Conference. The changing political scenario that emerged in Kashmir almost simultaneously
                            with the partition of India finally resulted in the Pakistan-led tribal invasion of 22nd
                            October 1947. When the tribal raiders, abetted and assisted by the regular Pakistan army,
                            entered the border regions of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir, a wave of terror was
                            swept across from Muzafarabad down to the commercial town of Baramula, at least 25 km from
                            Srinagar. Shops and houses were looted and plundered and set on fire. Women were kidnapped,
                            molested, and abducted. Lurid tales of woe and sufferings of the residents of these areas
                            (mostly Hindus and Sikhs) reached Srinagar in no time which further magnified the
                            all-pervading sense of dread. The havoc created by the severe devastation caused by the
                            raiders in almost all the frontier villages and towns generated a feeling of strange
                            eerieness that engulfed the whole valley.<br><br>

                            Owing to the precarious situation prevailing in Srinagar due to the collapse of the
                            administrative machinery, weak state military arrangements, and the Pakistani raiders at the
                            doorstep, the National Conference volunteers were called upon to come forward and render
                            their services in the protection of their motherland. Somnath Bira, an active member of the
                            National Conference with a progressive outlook responded ly to the call and took up the
                            responsibility of preparing some sort of civil resistance as the first line of defence of
                            the valley. Somnath Bira along with some other volunteers of the National Conference played
                            a pioneering role in the formation of Peace Brigade units. Though woefully lacking military
                            training or war tactics, Somnath Bira and his volunteer team acted ly to guard against the
                            Kabali attack.<br><br>

                            Referring to the reports of a possible incrusion in Srinagar, Bira mobilized his co-workers
                            and played a lead role in the organisation of a volunteer corps to maintain peace and
                            safeguard the motherland from the impending tribal attack. The response was overwhelming.
                            Within no time, the peace brigade, initially known by the name Bachau Fauj (Protection
                            Force) or Salamati Fauj was organised. Marching and Sloganeering with revolutionary fervor,
                            Somnath Bira and his associates moved down the lanes and streets, bolstering the confidence
                            of the people of Srinagar. Taking inspiration from Bira, a number of young men in the Peace
                            Brigade started offering guard duties on bridges, bazaars, and telephone and telegraph
                            exchanges. They also acted as guides for the army and along with the jawans, they patrolled
                            the streets of Srinagar and sought to defend the main points of entry in the city.<br><br>

                            However, the reports of the rapid advance of the mercurial raiders and the continuous
                            migration of the refugees with their woeful stories of the atrocities committed on the
                            non-muslims and their brutal killings created communal tensions in the surrounding region's
                            valley. Around this time, the peace brigade was bifurcated into different units and assigned
                            the task of holding charge of different areas to combat the communal tensions and to stall
                            the march of raiders, in case an invasion occurs. One such peace Brigade in which Somnath
                            Bira was also a leading member, was assigned the charge of the Doda-Bhaderwah area to calm
                            down the communal tensions that had erupted there. However, after successfully accomplishing
                            their duty, when the Brigade members were returning back to Srinagar, Bira was found
                            missing. It is believed that he was shot dead by the hostile forces near a place called
                            Reghi Nallah, somewhere between Doda and Bhaderwah. The exact location where his body fell
                            remained unknown even to his group members and unfortunately, the body of this young and
                            passionate martyr could never be recovered. The life of this young intellectual was silenced
                            while performing his patriotic duties in the service of the nation.<br><br>

                        <p>
                            Kedar Nath Sahni was born on 24 October 1926 at Thatta village of Rawalpindi. His father,
                            Keshav Das Sahni, was a squadron leader in the army. It was this army background that became
                            the primary source of his disciplined and courageous life.<br><br>

                            After completing his primary education, he came to Jammu in 1942 for further studies and
                            joined the Prince of Wales College (now GGM Science College) . It was during his stay at
                            Jammu that he met Sri Premnath Dogra, the chief organizer (Sangha Chalak) of the Rashtriya
                            Swayamsewak Sangha. Influenced by his ideology and working style, he joined the volunteer
                            group, and later, after completing his studies, he made Mirpur the core area of his
                            volunteer activities.<br><br>

                            At the time of partition, Sri Kedarnath Sahni was the district pracharak of Mirpur, a
                            district headquarters of the western part of Jammu province which was predominantly a Muslim
                            majority area. Hindus, who were less than ten percent of the population, constituted the
                            business community. It was a center of influential Mahajans who had trading relations with
                            Jammu.<br><br>

                            After ravaging Bhimber and Kotli- both the tehsil headquarters within the Mirpur district,
                            the Pakistani raiders reached this strategic town on 25th November 1947. Unfortunately,
                            after the fall of Bhimber and Kotli, Mirpur had been cut off from Jammu. The state garrison
                            stationed there had been running out of ammunition due to constant firing against the
                            raiders. Terror-stricken helpless civilians began to run in panic. However, hardly two
                            thousand people strugglingly managed to reach Jhanger safely while the rest were either
                            killed or taken away as captives. A number of women were abducted and sold in bazaars of
                            Peshawer and Rawalpindi. The repeated request and persuasion with the central authorities
                            for the reinforcement of the Indian army in Mirpur was turned down and was rather diverted
                            to Kashmir region due to the indifferent attitude of the state authorities towards these
                            areas.<br><br>

                            In the midst of the barbarity of the Pakistani army, the resonance of a ray of hope during
                            this seething turmoil could be seen in the commendable work of Sri Kedarnath Sahni and that
                            too, at that particular time, when the state troops and the officials lost heart and
                            retreated, leaving behind the helpless civilians at the mercy of the dreaded raiders. It was
                            no other than Kedarnath Sahni and his team of volunteers who saved the lives of thousands of
                            Hindus and Sikhs who were migrating to Jhanger in caravans from Mirpur and other adjoining
                            areas.<br><br>

                            During the time of the Pakistani tribal attack, Sri Kedarnath ji was at Sangh headquarters
                            at Deewana Mandir, Jammu. As soon as he got the news of the mass massacre of Hindus and
                            Sikhs in the district of Mirpur, Sahni Ji, with the help of some active volunteers including
                            Sri Gopal Dutt Mehangi, Sri Jagdish Abrol, and others immediately managed the humanitarian
                            aid and food (dal mixed chapattis) prepared in the houses of the local people and packed in
                            small bags for the migrating refugees. Around twenty-five lorries packed with this food,
                            bags proceeded towards Jhangar where the caravans of the people from Mirpur were advancing.
                            The Lorries reached safely to Jhangar where sangha sewaks distributed those dal mixed
                            chapattis to nearly 4,500 refugees from Mirpur and subsequently, helped these caravans to
                            reach Jammu safely where under the supervision of Sri Kedarnath Sahni, the people of Jammu
                            had made further arrangements for providing humanitarian aid to these refugees.<br><br>

                            His daunting task of saving the lives of helpless people of Mirpur and adjoining areas is a
                            remarkable example of his sense of duty towards his nation and his feelings of patriotism
                            which is inspirational. Later, he joined active politics and served the nation in various
                            capacities as Governor of Sikkim (2001-2002) and Governor of Goa (2002-2004).

                        <p>Shankarlal Dwarkadas Parikh was born at Kathlal of Kheda district on 4 June 1886. He attended
                            the session of the Indian National Congress held in 1910. As a representative of the Gujarat
                            Congress Provincial Committee, he also participated in the Bombay Provincial Conference at
                            Nashik in 1916. He took part in the Kheda satyagraha as well as in Nagpur Jhanda Satyagraha
                            where he served as the secretary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. Shankarlal was arrested during
                            the Salt Satyagraha in 1930 and was imprisoned at Sabarmati jail and later at Visapur jail.
                            He worked at the Kapadvanj Taluka Congress Committee, Kheda District Congress Committee,
                            Gujarat Provincial Congress Committee, and Kheda District Local Board. He was closely
                            associated with the educational, social, and political activities of Kathlal. He was
                            appointed as an honorary magistrate by the Indian government in 1947. He died on 12 March

                        <p>Ramakrishna Pillai was a great journalist in British Travancore who expressed great courage
                            to oppose British rule in Travancore, especially the oppressive rule of Diwan of Travancore.
                            He was born on 25 May 1878 at Neyyattinkara in Thiruvananthapuram. Immediately after his
                            school education, he became the editor of the newspaper Kerala Darpanam in 1900 from
                            Trivandrum. Later he became editor of Kerala Panchika and Malayali in 1903. Though he
                            started a magazine namely Keralan in 1905, it was stopped immediately due to various
                            reasons.<br><br>

                            He became very famous as the editor of the newspaper Swadeshabhimani in January 1906 at
                            Thiruvananthapuram. This newspaper was established by the prominent Muslim reformer Vakkom
                            Abdul Khader Moulavi. Because of his intimate connection with this newspaper, he came to be
                            known as ‘Swadeshabhimani Ramakrishna Pillai’. He severely criticized the corruption and
                            misrule of the British officers in Travancore. Through this newspaper, fearless Ramakrishna
                            Pillai even strongly opposed Diwan of Travancore P. Rajagopalachari.<br><br>

                            Due to his fearless journalism, the government arrested him and deported him to Tirunelveli
                            in Madras state from Travancore on 26th September 1910. The government banned the
                            Swadeshabhimani newspaper and the printing press was confiscated. Later in 1913, he reached
                            Palakkad in Malabar and wrote the book The Travancore Deportation. This book was a great
                            boost to the freedom movement of Kerala. He died on 28 March 1916.</p><br><br>

                        <p>
                            Perunchiththiranar was born on 10 March 1933 in Salem, Tamil Nadu to Duraiswamy and Mrs.
                            Kunjammal Duraiswamy. He wrote Tamil poems from his school days. He was an excellent poet,
                            later earning even the appreciation and applause of Bharathidasan. Perunchiththiranar's
                            commitment to independent Tamil Nadu was unswerving and constant. In 1972 he organized the
                            first Tamil Nadu Freedom Conference. So the government's tactic was to issue prohibitory
                            order against the meeting saying that it would "disturb the peace". People, however,
                            attended the conference in spite of the prohibitory order. Perunchiththiranar and some
                            others were arrested for violating the order and he spent a week in jail. He organized
                            similar conferences in 1973 and 1974 also. He participated in the "Tamil Nadu National
                            Self-Determination Conference" organized by the Tamil National Movement (TNM) (Tamil Desiya
                            Iyakkam) President P. Nedumaran in Thanjai in 1990. Perunchiththiranar himself was
                            imprisoned 8 times, spending a total of about 27 months in jail, for his various activities

                            Anjalai was once a soldier who served under the command of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, a
                            prominent figure in the struggle for India's independence. Netaji, a contemporary of Mahatma
                            Gandhi, founded the Indian National Army (INA) in 1943 with the support of the Japanese
                            during World War II to fight the British. She joined at the age of 21 years in INA. She
                            belonged to the Rani of Jhansi Regiment, the women's regiment of the INA. She was first sent
                            to Singapore for basic military training and then deployed to Burma. Her sacrifice, valour,
                            determination, and courage will find an undiminished place in the history of India's

                            Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru came to Nagapattinam and the young Rajan was attracted by his speech
                            which created an inspiration for the freedom movement. A few years later he came to Karikal
                            with his father. In 1942 freedom fighters and Communist leaders in Karaikalshri V. Ponnaih,

                        <p>Kartar Singh (1902-1974) was born on 22 February 1902 in the Chak No. 40 district of Lyallpur
                            (Faisalabad, now in Pakistan). His family was originally from Nagoke village in the Amritsar
                            district. Following the annexation of Punjab on March 29, 1849, the British government
                            established canal colonies in Lyallpur, and Kartar Singh's family migrated there. He
                            received his early education at the village gurudwara before enrolling in Khalsa School in
                            neighboring Chak No. 41, where he matriculated in 1921. He had a religious bent of mind and
                            during his school days, he led a kirtan jatha, or group of hymn singers, earning him the
                            moniker Giani (learned in religious texts). For further studies, he enrolled at Khalsa
                            College, Amritsar.<br><br>

                            The Jallianwala Bagh Massacre profoundly influenced him, and he became interested in
                            politics. When Michael O'Dwyer killed several innocent people in Amritsar, he was there.
                            This event, as well as the martial law conditions in Punjab under which he travelled from
                            Amritsar to his village, had a profound effect on his mind. In 1920, he and a group of
                            fellow students raised funds for Mahatma Gandhi's Tilak Swaraj Fund.<br><br>

                            Kartar Singh led a group of students to a Sikh conference in Dharowali village, near Dera
                            Baba Nanak, in early October 1920. Later on, Shiromani Akali Dal was founded as a Sikh
                            representative body on December 14, 1920. He was appointed general secretary of the
                            Shiromani Akali Dal's Lyallpur district unit in 1924. During the Jaito Morcha (February
                            1924), he was arrested for welcoming and serving langar to a Shaheedi Jatha (martyr's group)
                            on its way to Nabha to participate in the Morcha. He was sentenced to six months in the
                            Cambellpur Jail for this.<br><br>

                            In 1926, he was elected to the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee, which had been
                            reconstituted under the Sikh Gurdwaras Act of 1925. In October 1927, he became a member of
                            its executive committee. He led a protest against the Simon Commission's visit to India on
                            October 30, 1928, at the Lahore Railway Station, shouting "Simon, Go Back!" During the Civil
                            Disobedience Movement, he was arrested and sentenced to one year in prison for delivering
                            seditious speeches.<br><br>

                            Kartar Singh was elected to the executive committees of both the Shiromani Gurdwara
                            Parbandhak Committee and the Shiromani Akali Dal in 1933. He was elected to the Punjab
                            Legislative Assembly from the Lyallpur district in 1937. In 1943, Kartar Singh proposed his
                            Azad Punjab scheme in response to Pakistan's Muslim League demand. The scheme envisioned a
                            Punjab in which no single religious community held a sway. As a representative of Sikhs,
                            Master Tara Singh, Akali Stalwart, pursued this scheme in political negotiations with the
                            Congress, Muslim League, and British.<br><br>

                            Kartar Singh was elected president of the Shiromani Akali Dal in January 1947. On June 3,
                            1947, Viceroy Mountbatten declared the partition plan. During these turbulent days, Kartar
                            Singh, at great personal risk, assisted in the migration of Sikhs to India, particularly
                            from the districts of Lyallpur and Sheikhupura. On March 17, 1948, the Shiromani Akali Dal
                            working committee, led by him, passed a resolution allowing all Akali members of the East
                            Punjab Assembly to join the Congress. Kartar Singh joined the Congress and was appointed
                            Revenue Minister in the East Punjab government of Chief Minister Gopi Chand Bhargava. He
                            made his mark in rehabilitating the refugees from Pakistan. Here, he was ably assisted by
                            Dr. M. S. Randhawa.</p>

                        <p>Kanailal Datta(1888-1908), son of Chunilal Datta, was born in Chandannagore in the Hooghly
                            district of West Bengal. He had his early education in Dupleix Vidyamandir followed by his
                            BA degree from Muhammad Mohasin College, Hooghly.<br><br>

                            A French colony, Chandannagore was at that time a safe shelter and a happy recruiting center
                            for revolutionaries. Kanailal had his arms training as a school student. After his BA
                            examination (April 1908), he secured a revolver from Matilal Roy of the Prabartak Samgha and
                            shifted to Calcutta. He was initially shortlisted for the Muzaffarpur event but was later
                            engaged in making bombs at Yugantar’s Gopimohan Datta Lane hideout. As a fallout of the
                            Manicktala Bomb Case, he was arrested on 2 May 1908 and sent to the Alipore Central
                            Jail.<br><br>

                            Meanwhile, a fellow revolutionary turned approver, Naren Gosain confessed that everything,
                            from Muzaffarpur to Alipore, was designed by Aurobindo Ghosh; leaders decided to eliminate
                            him prior to his submission to the court. Kanailal and another jail mate Satyendranath Bose
                            were chosen for the job. The way they accomplished it, to borrow Matilal Roy, was a unique
                            tale of heroism, dare-devilry, and unmitigated sacrifice for the motherland. Both of them
                            were sentenced to death.<br><br>

                            Later, when the British Magistrate asked Kanailal, a boy of twenty years, about his crime;
                            he replied, ‘I have killed a traitor.’ Magistrate repeated, ‘Do you want to appeal?’ He
                            rebutted ‘No, there shall be no appeal.’ On 10 November 1908, Kanailal was hanged to death
                            inside the jail in the early morning; the same day Calcutta witnessed one of its longest
                            processions in history, with his mortal remains.</p>

                            life. That is why in 1922, he refused to go to London for higher studies and joined the
                            freedom struggle.<br><br>

                        <p>Batan Singh was born in 1886 in Kahri village of Hoshiarpur district. Mehar Singh Bains, his
                            father, was a farmer, and Attri, his mother, was a housewife. He served in the British
                            Indian Army's 76 Platoon for a short time before emigrating to Canada.<br><br>

                            He, like other immigrants, faced racial discrimination in Canada and became a vociferous
                            critic of British rule. He was a vocal opponent of the proposed deportation of Indians to
                            the Honduras Islands in 1908. During court proceedings, approver Bela Singh remarked that he
                            urged emigrants to return to India to evict the British if they were forcibly transferred to
                            Honduras. In their judgment, judges said that the true case against Batan Singh began when
                            Bhagwan Singh arrived in Canada in 1913. Bhagwan Singh was a fiery orator who later became
                            Ghadar Party's president. He organized multiple meetings with Bhagwan Singh, telling the
                            audience that staying in Canada was useless as the British administration was repressive and
                            that they should return to India to lead an insurrection against the British. He was a
                            member of the Shore Committee formed to assist the passengers of the Komagata Maru (Guru
                            Nanak Jahaz) Ship. Canadian authorities looked upon him as one of the dangerous men in the
                            place. When British intelligence officer, William Hopkinson was killed in Vancouver, he was
                            arrested on suspicion but later he was released.<br><br>

                            At the call of the Ghadar Party, Batan Singh left Canada and travelled to India via Columbo.
                            On 25 March 1915, on his arrival in Punjab, he was detained and implicated in the Second
                            Lahore Conspiracy Case. Approvers Bela Singh, Mangal Singh, and Amar Singh testified against
                            him. Judges found that he participated in instigating and organizing a return to India for
                            mutiny, which resulted in individuals returning, and that he himself returned for the same
                            intention but was interned in India before he could cause any harm. On 5 January 1917, the
                            judges pronounced their decision. He was sentenced to life imprisonment under sections 121
                            and 121-A of the Indian Penal Code, and his confiscable property was ordered to be forfeited
                            to the Crown. Batan Singh was transferred to Bihar's Hazaribagh Jail. He was released from
                            prison during the Royal Clemency of 1920. After his release, he continued his struggle
                            against the British and actively participated in the Gurdwara Reform Movement. He parted
                            ways with the moderate Akali Dal after the terrible massacre of over 100 innocent Sikhs in
                            the Nankana Sahib Gurdwara. He along with Babbar Kishan Singh Gargaj decided to punish the
                            perpetrators of the Nankana Sahib tragedy. They planned to kill Sunder Singh Majitihia,
                            Mahant Narayan Das, and other British officials. However, their scheme did not achieve
                            success as two of their accomplices were caught in the police net. He went into hiding.
                            Authorities announced a monetary reward for information on his whereabouts. Unfortunately,
                            Battan Singh was mauled by a rabid dog in Lahore. In Dalhousie, doctors treated him but the
                            virus infection became incurable, and he passed away in July 1921.<br><br>

                            The Babbar Akali Movement suffered a loss with his passing. Vancouver Gurdwara Committee
                            paid a rich tribute by passing a resolution appreciating his services to the community. </p>

                        <p>Rettamalai Srinivasan was born on 7 July 1859 in village Kozhiyalam, Maduranthagam. His
                            father’s name was Rettamalai. Srinivasan was fondly called Thatha by the people. As the
                            first graduate among the Scheduled Caste, he passed Bachelor of Law from Coimbatore
                            Government Arts College. During the early days of his political career in Nilgiris, he
                            closely worked with the Theosophical Society and Henry Steele Olcott. After coming to
                            Chennai in 1890, Rettamalai Srinivasan established the Paraiyar Mahajana Sabha in 1891 which
                            later became Adi-Dravida Mahajana Sabha in 1893. In October 1893 he founded a Tamil
                            newspaper at the age of 32, called ‘Paraiyan’, which highlighted the sufferings of the
                            Depressed Classes.<br><br>

                            He met Gandhiji thrice at Yeravada Jail, on the Poona Pact issue, though critical of his
                            stand on issues of untouchability, religion-based reforms, and separate electorates. He
                            stated “Gandhiji was a great soul. On behalf of depressed classes, he collected lakhs of
                            rupees and spent them on the education of their children, fought so many years to eradicate
                            untouchability but was not able to change the heart of the caste Hindus”.<br><br>

                            He was also instrumental in the formation of a Labour Welfare Department in 1919 by the
                            British government to ameliorate the sufferings of the Depressed Classes. He was the
                            President of the first Adi Dravidars Provincial Conference held at Pachiayappan College of
                            Chennai in 1928. Rettamalai Srinivasan represented the Paraiyars in the first two Round
                            Table Conferences in London (1930 and 1931) along with B. R. Ambedkar. He states that “Both
                            me and Ambedkar worked as nail and esh, we both went as representatives of the DCs at the
                            Second Round Table Conference in London and fought for their political rights. British
                            Government honored him with Rao Sahib in the year 1926 at Madras, Rao Bahadur in 1930, and
                            Diwan Bahador in the year 1936.</p>

                        <p>He was born on the 30 October 1908 in Pasumpon in the Ramanathapuram district of Tamil Nadu.
                            He was a freedom-fighter cum spiritual leader and was seen as a deity among the Mukulathor
                            community. The people of the Mukulathor community still make offerings as is done for the
                            deities in temples to the statue on his birthday and guru pooja celebrations. He did not
                            accept traditional Hinduism because it supported the ‘Varnashrama’. He regularly fought
                            against the evils of the Hindu religion. Thevar became a full-time member of the Congress
                            party and attended the 1927 Congress session at Madras as a volunteer when he was just 19.
                            He became a close aide of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. Netaji introduced Thevar to his mother
                            as his younger sibling.<br><br>

                            Thevar served as the deputy chairman of the All India Forward Bloc (AIFB) since 1952. He was
                            elected three times to the AIFB national parliament board. The Temple Entry Authorization
                            and Indemnity Act were passed by the government of C. Rajagopalachari in 1939. It removed
                            restrictions that prevented Dalits from entering Hindu temples. He supported the change and
                            in July 1939 assisted activist A. Vaidyanatha Iyer to take Dalits to the Meenakshi Temple in
                            Madurai. The Criminal Tribes Act (CTA), enacted by the British in 1920, was against the
                            Mukulathor community, in which Thevar protested by mobilizing people and starting protests
                            that were a major milestone in his career. The Act criminalized the entire community by
                            branding them as habitual criminals. He was instrumental in getting the Act repealed after
                            continuous efforts in 1946. He died on October 30, 1963.</p>

                        <p>Vaithamanithi Mudumbai Kothainayaki Ammal (1 December 1901 – 20 February 1960) was a Tamil
                            writer, novelist, and journalist who is remembered as the first woman to occupy the
                            editorial board of a Tamil magazine. She wrote 115 books and published a monthly Tamil
                            magazine, Jaganmohini. Vai. Mu. Kothainayaghi was the first female writer in Tamil, to write
                            a detective novel. She had a multifarious personality and she excelled in fields like public
                            speaking, social service, and fiction writing and was a keen freedom fighter too. She was
                            hailed as the "Queen of Fictions" by her contemporary authors. However, she was not well
                            recognized in the books on the history of Tamil literature. Kothai had no formal schooling
                            and she could not read or write at the time of her marriage. Her husband was insistent that
                            Kothai should be educated. She also learned the Telugu language from her mother-in-law. Even
                            though Kothai could not read or write, she often used to sing verses from Thiruvaimozhi at
                            home. This helped her to a great extent to become proficient in the Tamil language. It is
                            said that the celebrated singer Ms. D.K. Pattammal was greatly encouraged by Kothainayaki to
                            give public performances. Mahakavi Bharathiar was also said to be a great fan of
                            Kothainayaki's singing. Young Kothai regularly sang for All India Radio and also released
                            several gramophone records.<br><br>

                            Responding to the Mahatma's call in 1931, she participated in the Satyagraha agitation
                            against toddy and liquor shops and was arrested by the police. The trial court found her
                            guilty and awarded a prison sentence of 6 months which was increased to 8 months when she
                            refused to pay the fine that was imposed on her by the court. In 1932 she was again
                            sentenced for participation in the agitation against the Lodhi Commission and the stir for
                            the boycott of foreign clothes. While serving her sentences in prison, she continued her
                            passion for writing novels, many of which contained the true-life incidents of co-prisoners
                            as themes and main plots. Her husband Parthasarathy managed the magazine Jaganmohini during
                            her imprisonment. After Mahatma Gandhi was assassinated in 1948, to commemorate his memory
                            she started an association called Mahatmaji Seva Sangam to help the poor and orphaned
                            children. When the then Congress government gave 10 acres of land in recognition of her
                            public service, and patriotism she handed over all the 10 acres of land to Sri Vinobha Bhave
                            for his Bhoodan movement.</p>

                            freedom was the backbone of India’s freedom struggle.<br><br>

                            A V Kuttimalu Amma was one such freedom fighter and prominent social worker who hailed from
                            the Malabar region of present-day Kerala. Born in 1905, in the Anakkara Vadakath family: a
                            family that gave the nation many women activists and social workers like Captain Lakshmi,
                            Mrinalini Sarabhai, Subashini Ali, etc., Kuttimalu Amma grew up hearing stories about the
                            works of great personalities like Mahatma Gandhi, Sarojini Naidu and other great leaders. It
                            was post her marriage in 1926, that she began her work as a public activist when Gandhiji
                            visited the state in connection with his mission on the upliftment of the Harijans.<br><br>

                            Kuttimalu Amma was an active member of the Mahila Sangh in Calicut. In 1930, when prominent
                            leaders like Vallabhbhai Patel and Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya were arrested, it was decided
                            to observe 15 August 1930 as All India Political Sufferers’ Day. The Mahila Sangh, under the
                            leadership of Kuttimalu, went around the town to propagate this. This was the first time
                            when the women in Malabar joined the national freedom struggle directly. Kuttimalu was also
                            an active swadeshi worker and encouraged other women to wear only khadi and motivated them
                            to boycott foreign cloth. In 1931, she led groups of women to picket shops selling foreign
                            cloth in Calicut.<br><br>

                            Kuttimalu was driven by sheer determination, and this is evident from the fact that despite
                            being incarcerated multiple times in her political career, she continued to take part in the
                            freedom movement with the same vigour. In 1932, during the Civil Disobedience Movement,
                            Kuttimalu, breaking the ban order, led a procession of women holding her 2-month-old baby in
                            her arms. She was arrested and put to 2 years of rigorous imprisonment. When she reached the
                            jail, she was prevented from taking her baby in with her. The firebrand that she was, she
                            quoted the relevant rules and laws and thereby managed to take her baby to jail with her.
                            This daring act of hers greatly motivated other women to come forth and take part in the
                            freedom movement.</p>

                        <p>A staunch Ghadar Party revolutionary, Jagat Singh Binjal hailed from the Ludhiana district of
                            Punjab. His father’s name was Sada Singh, a peasant of modest means. He was related to
                            Nidhan Singh Chugga, Kanshi Ram, Rehmat Ali, and Gandha Singh’s group. After the return of
                            emigrant ghadarites, the police administration was on high . Governor Michael O’Dwyer issued
                            orders to arrest or shoot the suspicious persons. During this time, ghadarites planned to
                            attack the Ferozepur Cantonment. On November 26, 1914, sixty Ghadar Party members gathered
                            outside the Ferozepur Cantonment. However, Kartar Singh Sarabha informed them that British
                            authorities had got wind of their plan and had disarmed the sympathetic soldiers. The plan
                            was abandoned, and the ghadarites dispersed. On their way back to Moga, a police party in
                            Ghal Kalan Village intercepted Jagat Singh and other ghadarites. In the ensuing clash,
                            Bisharat Ali, a police sub-inspector, and Jawala Singh, a Zaildar were killed. Villagers
                            mistook ghadarites for thieves and surrounded them. Meantime, more reinforcements came.
                            Ghadarites ran towards the nearby reeds to hide. Police set on fire the entire area.
                            Ghadarites were trapped in the reeds. They found themselves surrounded by a large number of
                            policemen and village folk. Jagat Singh and six other ghadarites were apprehended. On
                            February 2, 1915, he was tried by Ferozepur Session Judge under sections 149, 302, 114, 307,
                            402, and 399. The judge noted that there were seven charges against him; he was the man who
                            murdered Basharat Ali, an offence under section 302, Indian Penal Code. The court sentenced
                            him to death in less than a month, making a mockery of the entire legal process. On 27 March
                            1915, Jagat Singh was hanged in the Montgomery Jail. The British did not allow family
                            members to meet him for the last time. He was either buried inside the jail or his death was
                            never revealed to his family members.</p>

                        <p>Laxmi Indira Panda was born on 1930 in Myanmar. She was born in a camp near Rangoon where her
                            father was employed by the local unit of Subhas Chandra Bose's Indian National Army. He
                            along with his wife was killed in a British bombardment. Young Laxmi was only 14 then and
                            had also a brother younger than her for looking after.<br><br>

                            The determination to avenge the death of her parents made her go to the I.N.A. Camp where
                            she begged for enrolment in the rank and file. The frail Laxmi was refused by the Camp
                            commanders. However, she stayed put outside the camp gates, and when Subhas Chandra Bose
                            came for inspection, she blocked his way. She was personally taken aside from him, and her
                            determination melted the hearts of the I.N.A. leaders including Subhas. She conveyed her
                            deep desire to join the freedom struggle by saying that age should not be an obstacle in the
                            path of patriotism. After knowing that she was an Odia, Subhas became more sympathetic to
                            her and allowed her in the Rani Jhansi Regiment under Captain Lakshmi Sehgal. Initially, she
                            was given soft jobs of housekeeping and cooking, but the young Laxmi soon proved her mettle
                            and won the hearts of her superiors. She was trained in swordsmanship, shooting, and
                            espionage. As she was well versant with the Burmese language, she was often sent across
                            enemy lines for the collection of intelligence. She was working with all the iconic INA
                            heroes such as Janaki Thevar, Gown, Shah Nawaz Khan, and Dhillon besides Lakshmi Sehgal. Six
                            months of intensive arms training in Burma shaped Laxmi into battle readiness for the onward
                            march to the battlefront on the India-Burma border.<br><br>

                            She was right by their side of Netaji up till the time he gave the call for disbandment of
                            the INA. She recollects seeing Netaji in Singapore last time on 8 August 1945 after which
                            she came to know about his death in an air crash.</p>

                            in the 1920s left her home in England to live and work with Mohandas Gandhi.<br><br>

                            Her aristocratic existence took a life-changing turn after she read French novelist and

                            fascinated by the principles of nonviolence and contacted Gandhi himself, asking if she

                            was with Gandhi at the London Round Table Conference in 1931. She was arrested multiple

                            of civil disobedience in 1932–33, when she was detained on the charge of supplying

                        <p>Gaidinliu was born on January 26, 1915, in present-day Tamenglong district of Manipur and
                            died in 1993. The Naga
                            spiritual and political leader, who led an armed uprising against the British in Manipur,
                            Nagaland and Assam, belonged
                            to the Rongmei tribe (also known as Kabui). In 1927, at the age of 13, Gaidinliu, along with
                            her cousin Haipou Jadonang,
                            joined the Heraka movement, which aimed at revival of the Naga tribal religion and establish
                            self-rule of the Nagas
                            (Naga Raj) ending the British rule.<br><br>

                            She was arrested in 1932 when she was just 16, and was sentenced to life imprisonment by the
                            British rulers. Between
                            1932 and 1947, the Naga freedom fighter was kept at several prisons across the
                            Northeast.<br><br>

                            After being released in 1947 she continued to work for the betterment of the community.
                            Nehru described Gaidinliu as the
                            “daughter of the hills” and he gave her the title of ‘Rani’ for her courage. She was also
                            awarded a Padma Bhushan.<br><br>

                            The state government has developed a park along with a statue to honour the late freedom
                            fighter in Silchar, Assam.<br><br>

                            The Government of India issued a postal stamp in her honour in 1996, and commemorative coin

                        <p>Brigadier Rajinder Singh Jamwal, also remembered as the Saviour of Kashmir, was an officer in
                            the Jammu and Kashmir
                            State Forces who died fighting during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947–1948. <br><br>

                            He and his troops held on to their positions in Uri for three days from 23rd October 1947 to
                            26th October 1947. They
                            repelled waves of enemy attack and stood until the last bullet. On 27th October 1947, the
                            Maharaja of Kashmir signed the
                            instrumentation of annexation with India. India troops quickly rushed in to support
                            Brigadier Rajinder Singh. <br><br>

                            These three days were crucial because if Srinagar would have fallen, then Kashmir might
                            never have been part of India.<br><br>

                            Brigadier Rajinder Singh was honored posthumously with the MahaVir Chakra by Army chief

                        <p>Jatindra Nath Das worked at a very young age for the cause of political prisoners in the
                            Indian freedom struggle. Being
                            an inspirational freedom fighter, human rights activist and a fervent revolutionary, he
                            joined the AnushilanSamiti (a
                            20th century Indian revolutionary organization). He collaborated with Bhagat Singh and other
                            members from the Hindustan
                            Republican Socialist Association (HRSA). While he was 17 years old, he got actively involved
                            in the Non-Cooperation
                            Movement launched by Gandhiji.<br><br>

                            Jatindra Nath Das breathed his last in 1929 following a 63-day-long fast fighting for the
                            rights of political prisoners
                            at the young age of 25 years. Bhagat Singh and other imprisoned freedom fighters also
                            undertook this hunger strike at
                            the Lahore Central Jail. Jatindra Das had to face several atrocities and hardships done by
                            the British authorities.
                            These atrocities led to damaging of his lungs, and paralysis began to spread to his body
                            parts. Still he continued his
                            hunger strike. A jail committee was formed keeping in mind his condition into consideration
                            and immense popularity
                            amongst people. A proposal was made for his release but it was rejected by the committee.
                            Subhas Chandra Bose called him
                            the 'young Dadhichee' of the nation (the ancient Indian sage who sacrificed his life for a
                            noble cause).

                        <p>Suniti Chaudhuri(1917 – 1988) and Shanti Ghosh are names of two brave schoolgirls whose
                            fearless feat was recalled by
                            Netaji in Singapore while referring to the courage of Indian women to Rani Jhansi cadets of
                            the INA(Indian national
                            army). Daughter of Umacharan Chaudhuri, Suniti was born in Comilla of the undivided Bengal.
                            As a student of class eight
                            in the Faizunnisa School of the town, she and her enterprising classmate Shanti joined the
                            revolutionary Yugantar group,
                            primarily under the inspiration of their senior Pritilata Bramha. In 1931, they organized a
                            girls’ group (Chhatri
                            Samgha), with Suniti as captain, Shanti as secretary, and Pritilata as the president; and
                            started taking part in pistol
                            shooting and other martial arts from revolutionary Barun Bhattacharyya.<br><br>

                            On 14 December 1931, Suniti accompanied Shanti, aged 15 and 14 years respectively, to the
                            bungalow of Magistrate Stevens
                            with a pistol; while Shanti shot him dead at point-blank range. Spared of the death sentence
                            due to their age; they were
                            sentenced to life imprisonment and lodged in the Midnapore Central Jail as a third-class
                            prisoner, subjected to all
                            sorts of physical torture.<br><br>

                            Released in 1939, Suniti resumed her studies to eventually emerge as an MB doctor known for
                            her selfless and
                            compassionate service to the poor and afflicted persons. In 1947, she married trade union
                            leader Pradyot Kumar Ghosh.

                        <p>Bijoyananda (Biju) Patnaik was born in Cuttack, Orissa, on 5th March 1916 to Laxminarayan
                            Patnaik and Ashalata Devi. His
                            father was a great nationalist and was closely associated with two architects of modern
                            Orissa – Madhusudan Das and
                            Gopabandhu Das. Biju had his early education in Mission Primary School and Mission (Christ

                            tried to get a glimpse of the
                            Mahatma. After a brief stint as a pilot in the Royal Air Force, Biju got actively involved
                            in the Quit India Movement.
                            He was arrested on 13 January 1943, sentenced to two years imprisonment, and lodged in
                            Firozpur Fort Jail. After his
                            release from jail in 1945, Biju was elected to Orissa Assembly in 1946 from North Cuttack

                        <p>Govinda Chandra Mishra was born in Tigiria on 25 August 1900. After his birth, his father
                            Kapil Mishra shifted to
                            Radhadamodarpur (Kantabandh) of Athagarh state with his family. Govinda was educated there
                            and started his business.
                            With success in his business, he constructed a multi-storied residential building, which was
                            the biggest in Athgarh in
                            his time.<br><br>

                            From his childhood, he was agitated by the oppression of the Raja, who extracted various
                            taxes from his people to meet
                            his lavish lifestyle. The people had to pay taxes for the fruits, and vegetables are grown
                            on their own farm and the
                            catching of fish in their own ponds. The extraction of so many taxes led to the rise of the
                            Prajamandal movement in
                            which Govinda took the prominent role as the secretary of the Working Committee of the
                            Athagarh Prajamandal Movement. At
                            the same time, he also took interest in the national movement under Mahatma Gandhi. When
                            Gandhi visited Athagarh, he
                            along with hundreds of people welcomed him at the Rajathgarh railway station.<br><br>

                            Since Govinda was widely respected by the people on whose call they joined Prajamandal
                            Movement, the king tried to win
                            him over by bribing him. But after Govinda rejected this offer, the king arrested him and
                            put him in jail. The king also
                            tried to murder him by administering poison in the jail but was not successful. After his
                            release when he intensified
                            the movement and the king was censured by the British Political Agent for misappropriating
                            the state’s funds, he was
                            forced to abdicate and hand over the administration to the Popular government formed by the
                            people. Govinda Chandra
                            Mishra was one of the members of this government in which he was a Minister. Sometimes he
                            also discharged his function
                            as king of the state. During this time he had issued patta of 3380 acres of land to 1980
                            poor people. Finally, when the
                            state was merged on 1 January 1948, the governance of popular government ended. He passed
                            away on 16 November 1952.

                        <p>Bijayananda Pattnaik, one of the main architects of modern Odisha, is popularly known as Biju
                            Pattnaik. He was born on 5
                            March 1916 to Lakshminarayan Pattnaik and Ashalata Pattnaik, a respectable Brahmo family of
                            Cuttack, though
                            Lakshminarayan was originally from Aska in Ganjam. He was a judicial Magistrate who had a
                            great interest in the identity
                            movement of the Odias for which he involved himself in a lot of cultural and literary
                            organizations in Cuttack. Besides
                            he also silently took interest in the freedom struggle of the country.<br><br>

                            Biju Pattnaik had inherited many traits of his father who inspired his son to become
                            courageous. He also inculcated in
                            his son the spirit of patriotism and a sense of pride for being an Odia. When Biju was just
                            11, he went to have a
                            glimpse of Mahatma Gandhi who was on a mission to Cuttack but was severely canned by the
                            British Police Superintendent
                            for violating the prohibitive order. Having seen his son screaming in pain, Lakshmi Narayan
                            told him that he should have
                            also slapped the white Police Superintendent for his arrogance instead of retreating from
                            the spot. These few words of
                            their father inspired him deeply he was determined to become bold and courageous in life.

                        </div>
                        <p>Bhagat Singh was born in the Rurhiwal village of Amritsar district. His father’s name was Bur
                            Chand. As a soldier, he
                            joined the 23rd Cavalry (Frontier Force), the personal escort of Punjab Governor Michael
                            O'Dwyer. In the last days of
                            1914, he met Prem Singh of Sur Singh village, a Ghadar Party member, and agreed to join the
                            fight for Indian
                            independence. The Ghadar Party was founded on America's Pacific Coast with the stated goal
                            of freeing India from the
                            yoke of British slavery. The idea for the Ghadar Party came from Indian immigrants who had
                            moved to the Pacific Coast of
                            North America to make a living. The Ghadar Movement arose in response to colonial
                            authorities' racist-cultural
                            attitudes, discriminatory immigration policies, and distorted legal procedures used to
                            restrict Indian citizens' entry
                            into America and Canada. It was a one-of-a-kind effort by worthy sons of the Indian
                            motherland. One of the Ghadar
                            Party's main goals was to persuade Indian troops to join the movement. <br><br>

                            The British were mass-recruiting young Indians to send to the front lines in World War I.
                            The Ghadar Party intended to use Indian soldiers to overthrow British rule. The
                            sowars of the 23rd Cavalry were persuaded to march out and join the armed rebellion at the
                            appointed hour. Bhagat Singh
                            and his colleagues sent a sword to the movement's leaders as a symbol of their assurance.
                            The Ghadar Party dispatched
                            emissaries to every cantonment in Northern India. Prem Singh of Sur Singh village met Bhagat
                            Singh and confided in him.
                            The general uprising was scheduled for November 30, 1914. The date was later rescheduled. At
                            the time, British officers
                            were completely unaware of the 23rd Cavalry Men's involvement in the Ghadar Party's planned
                            uprising. Sucha Singh of
                            Chola Sahib, however, and two other sowars were punished for their unscheduled absence from
                            the cantonment. The British
                            also put an end to the 21 February 1915 uprising plan. <br><br>

                            Meanwhile, the 23rd unit was assigned to the United Provinces (UP). On May 13, 1915, the
                            Sikh soldiers of the 23rd Cavalry were being shipped to the war front from Nowgong
                            Cantonment
                            in United Province (now MP). On the way, bombs exploded in a wooden box belonging to one of
                            the soldiers at Harpalpur
                            Station (MP). This explosion revealed to the officials the sowars' plan to join the Ghadar
                            revolution. Others were later
                            arrested, and their ties to the Ghadar Party were discovered. As a result, eighteen men were
                            detained. In Dagshai, near
                            Shimla, a court martial was held. Bhagat Singh received the death penalty. On September 3,
                            1915, he was hanged in Ambala
                            Jail. In his last time, the British were even forbidden from meeting him with his family
                            members.

                        <p>Sohan Lal Pathak was born on 7 January 1883, in Patti, district Amritsar. His father’s name
                            was Pandit Chanda Ram. Sohan
                            Lal was a deserving student who received numerous scholarships and awards at his local high
                            school. However, his
                            family's financial situation forced him to drop out of middle school and pursue a job with
                            the Irrigation Department as
                            Beldar. He left this job after a short time and enrolled in a Teacher Training School in
                            Lahore. He began working as a
                            school teacher after finishing his course. In 1901, he got married to Laksmi Devi of
                            Gurdaspur district.<br><br>

                            Sohan Lal Pathak was influenced by rising nationalistic feelings while still in Lahore. Lala
                            Lajpat Rai had a
                            significant influence on him. He quit his school job to work for Lajpat Rai's Urdu newspaper
                            Bande Matram. Lala Har
                            Dayal was also introduced to him in Lahore. Sohan Lal tragically lost his wife and child
                            during this period. In 1909, he
                            migrated to Siam. He moved to America from Siam, where he reconnected with Har Dayal, one of
                            the founding members of the
                            Ghadar Party. The Ghadar party's goal was to organise an uprising against the British
                            government in India. Sohan Lal
                            wasted no time in becoming an active party member. When the party began sending groups of
                            revolutionaries to India,
                            Sohan Lal took the initiative to organise a revolt among Indian soldiers stationed in Burma,
                            Malaysia, and Singapore.
                            The movement grew in Singapore. Under his influence, 2000 soldiers of Singapore prepared for
                            an uprising. Authorities
                            transferred 1000 of them but the remaining soldiers started an uprising. This rising was
                            continued on 14, 15, and 16
                            March 1915. English left Singapore. For 14 days, the city remained under the control of
                            soldiers. Later on, the British
                            sent heavy reinforcements and controlled the situation. The British brutally suppressed the
                            fearless revolt of Indian
                            soldiers stationed in Singapore.

                        <p>Kanailal Datta(1888-1908), son of Chunilal Datta, was born in Chandannagore in the Hooghly
                            district of West Bengal. He
                            had his early education in Dupleix Vidyamandir followed by his BA degree from Muhammad
                            Mohasin College, Hooghly.<br><br>

                            A French colony, Chandannagore was at that time a safe shelter and a happy recruiting center
                            for revolutionaries.
                            Kanailal had his arms training as a school student. After his BA examination (April 1908),
                            he secured a revolver from
                            Matilal Roy of the Prabartak Samgha and shifted to Calcutta. He was initially shortlisted
                            for the Muzaffarpur event but
                            was later engaged in making bombs at Yugantar’s Gopimohan Datta Lane hideout. As a fallout
                            of the Manicktala Bomb Case,
                            he was arrested on 2 May 1908 and sent to the Alipore Central Jail.<br><br>

                            Meanwhile, a fellow revolutionary turned approver, Naren Gosain confessed that everything,
                            from Muzaffarpur to Alipore,
                            was designed by Aurobindo Ghosh; leaders decided to eliminate him prior to his submission to
                            the court. Kanailal and
                            another jail mate Satyendranath Bose were chosen for the job. The way they accomplished it,
                            to borrow Matilal Roy, was a
                            unique tale of heroism, dare-devilry, and unmitigated sacrifice for the motherland. Both of
                            them were sentenced to
                            death.<br><br>

                            Later, when the British Magistrate asked Kanailal, a boy of twenty years, about his crime;
                            he replied, ‘I have killed a
                            traitor.’ Magistrate repeated, ‘Do you want to appeal?’ He rebutted ‘No, there shall be no
                            appeal.’ On 10 November 1908,
                            Kanailal was hanged to death inside the jail in the early morning; the same day Calcutta
                            witnessed one of its longest
                            processions in history, with his mortal remains.
