                        </div>
                        <p>Haripada Bhattacharyya (1915 - ?), son of Ambika Bhattacharyya, was born in Popdia, a tiny
                            village of the Boalkhali subdivision of Chittagong of the undivided Bengal. Born in a poor
                            family of a teacher in the elementary Sanskrit school (Tol), he could not afford to go to
                            school and had his basic education at home.<br><br>

                            Haripada was the youngest follower of Surya Sen, the hero of the Chittagong Uprising, who
                            did not let him join since he was only fourteen years old at the time.<br><br>

                            For Haripada, the opportunity came on 30 August 1930 at the Chittagong football ground, when
                            at the end of a match Khan Bahadur Asanulla Khan, a police inspector was waving the shield
                            from the dais due to the victory of his team. A notorious police officer, Mr. Khan was on
                            the hit list of revolutionaries for a long time. Harihada seized this opportunity; getting
                            closer to the dais he shot at Mr. Khan and killed him; nobody suspected him that a boy of
                            his stature could do this.<br><br>

                            Seized by the crowd, he was mercilessly beaten and paraded through the streets, profusely
                            bleeding. His parents were tied to the tree and tortured till they were in their senses;
                            their huts were drenched with kerosene and were put on fire. In the trial, he was spared the
                            death sentence in consideration of his age but was transmigrated for life to the Cellular
                            Jail.</p>

                        <p>A great revolutionary who spent twenty years of his life in a British prison, Nikhilranjan
                            Guharoy(1888-1974) was born in the Faridpur district of undivided Bengal. Nothing is known
                            about the village he was born in, his parentage, early life, education, and his political
                            association.<br><br>

                            His name surfaced in the Nadia-Shibpur dacoity case, which is important in the annals of the
                            Swadeshi dacoity for two reasons: the risk involved in the enterprise compared to its yield;
                            and the imprisonment of a large number of revolutionaries. For the revolutionaries, dacoity
                            was the only means to mobilize funds they needed to buy arms and ammunition.<br><br>

                            On 30 September 1915, a group of 25 revolutionaries armed with German Mauser pistols
                            attacked Krishnapada Biswas’s house at the midnight, a rich merchant in Shibpur village of
                            the Kotwali police station in Nadia. On their return journey in the boat, they opened fire
                            at the crowd chasing them which killed three people.<br><br>

                            Later, Nikhilranjan along with fifteen others was arrested and transmigrated for life. His
                            co-prisoners in Cellular Jail included Barindrakumar Ghosh, Upendranath Bandyopadhyay,
                            Ullaskar Datta, and Veer Savarkar. He was released along with other convicts during the
                            First World War; only to be sent back to the Cellular Jail again in the Kandi Bomb Case in
                            1930 till his final release in 1946.</p>

                        <p>A truly unsung hero, Sunil Kumar Chatterjee’s life is shrouded in obscurity. Nothing is known
                            about his parentage, birthplace, early education or political association. In 1932, he
                            surfaced in Calcutta in the revolutionary association.<br><br>

                            The early 1930s was a decade of sustained revolutionary activities in Bengal reaching its
                            peak with the Chittagong Uprising, which crippled the British administration in the city for
                            a couple of days. The Calcutta-based English newspaper, the Statesman, then edited by Mr.
                            Alfred Watson, was highly critical of the Indian nationalist movement. Mr. Watson’s
                            sustained campaign against them and advocacy of harsh punishment made him a target of the
                            Bengal revolutionaries. In his editorial column, he observed that all these revolutionaries
                            should be taken out of jails and hung on the lampposts of the city.<br><br>

                            On 5 August 1932, revolutionary Atul Sen of Khulna attacked him in the broad daylight in
                            Calcutta with a revolver and bombs; but he survived unhurt, while Atul Sen consumed poison
                            to avoid arrest. A more concerted attack followed two months later under Mani Lahiri. On 28
                            September, driving an open-hooted car, Mani Lahiri, Anil Bhaduri, Sunil Chatterjee, and
                            Biren Roy blocked Mr. Watson’s car on his way home, shot him, and also charged bombs leaving
                            him incapacitated for life.<br><br>

                            In a hurry, they met with an accident on the Majerhat Bridge; profusely bleeding Mani and
                            Anil consumed potassium cyanides to avoid arrest; Brien Roy escaped, while Sunil Chatterjee
                            was arrested. In the trial, he was sentenced to transportation for life; released in 1946
                            under a general amnesty.</p>

                            Martyred at the age of twenty-two years, Pramodranjan(1904-1926) was the son of Ishanchandra
                            Chaudhuri, Zamindar of Kelishahar in Chittagong of the undivided Bengal. Nothing is known
                            about his early education. Inspired by Charubikash Datta, he joined the Chittagong unit of
                            the Aunshilan Samiti as a student in 1920; and then shifted to Surya Sen’s group.<br><br>

                            Chittagong revolutionaries had a shelter at 4 Shovabazar Street, Calcutta with its link to
                            the All-Bengal Revolutionary Party hideout at Bachaspatipara Lane, Dakshineshwar in
                            24-Parganas. In a late-night swoop at these places (10 November 1925), police arrested
                            Pramodranjan, Anantahari Mitra, and others from Dakshineshwar, with a huge cache of a
                            revolver, ammunitions, bomb-making ingredients, and unlawful documents; In the trial, they
                            were sentenced to five years rigorous imprisonment.<br><br>

                            Inside the Alipore Jail, they killed Bhupendranath Chatterjee with an iron rod. A Deputy
                            Super in the intelligence branch of police, Bhupendranath met the inmates in the jail and
                            tried to get information from them. The revolutionaries thus decided to eliminate him. Five
                            prisoners claimed responsibilities at a time; police, having failed to fix the culprit,
                            arrested all of them. In the ensuing trial, Pramodranjan and Anantahari Mitra were sentenced
                            to death; the order was executed on 28 September 1926 in the Alipore Central Jail.

                        </div>
                        <p>
                            Somnath Bira was born in a Kashmiri Pandit family of Rainawari in Srinagar. He was a
                            postgraduate in History from Lahore University and did his research on the topic “ Kashmir
                            in the Eyes of Foreign Travellers”. P.N.Jalali, M.L.Misri, Peer Ghiyasuddin, N.N. Rai, and
                            O.N.Trisal, etc some of the famous personalities of the time were his batchmates. Somnath
                            Bira was associated with Sheikh Abdullah and was an active member of the National
                            Conference. The changing political scenario that emerged in Kashmir almost simultaneously
                            with the partition of India finally resulted in the Pakistan-led tribal invasion of 22nd
                            October 1947. When the tribal raiders, abetted and assisted by the regular Pakistan army,
                            entered the border regions of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir, a wave of terror was
                            swept across from Muzafarabad down to the commercial town of Baramula, at least 25 km from
                            Srinagar. Shops and houses were looted and plundered and set on fire. Women were kidnapped,
                            molested, and abducted. Lurid tales of woe and sufferings of the residents of these areas
                            (mostly Hindus and Sikhs) reached Srinagar in no time which further magnified the
                            all-pervading sense of dread. The havoc created by the severe devastation caused by the
                            raiders in almost all the frontier villages and towns generated a feeling of strange
                            eerieness that engulfed the whole valley.<br><br>

                            Owing to the precarious situation prevailing in Srinagar due to the collapse of the
                            administrative machinery, weak state military arrangements, and the Pakistani raiders at the
                            doorstep, the National Conference volunteers were called upon to come forward and render
                            their services in the protection of their motherland. Somnath Bira, an active member of the
                            National Conference with a progressive outlook responded ly to the call and took up the
                            responsibility of preparing some sort of civil resistance as the first line of defence of
                            the valley. Somnath Bira along with some other volunteers of the National Conference played
                            a pioneering role in the formation of Peace Brigade units. Though woefully lacking military
                            training or war tactics, Somnath Bira and his volunteer team acted ly to guard against the
                            Kabali attack.<br><br>

                            Referring to the reports of a possible incrusion in Srinagar, Bira mobilized his co-workers
                            and played a lead role in the organisation of a volunteer corps to maintain peace and
                            safeguard the motherland from the impending tribal attack. The response was overwhelming.
                            Within no time, the peace brigade, initially known by the name Bachau Fauj (Protection
                            Force) or Salamati Fauj was organised. Marching and Sloganeering with revolutionary fervor,
                            Somnath Bira and his associates moved down the lanes and streets, bolstering the confidence
                            of the people of Srinagar. Taking inspiration from Bira, a number of young men in the Peace
                            Brigade started offering guard duties on bridges, bazaars, and telephone and telegraph
                            exchanges. They also acted as guides for the army and along with the jawans, they patrolled
                            the streets of Srinagar and sought to defend the main points of entry in the city.<br><br>

                            However, the reports of the rapid advance of the mercurial raiders and the continuous
                            migration of the refugees with their woeful stories of the atrocities committed on the
                            non-muslims and their brutal killings created communal tensions in the surrounding region's
                            valley. Around this time, the peace brigade was bifurcated into different units and assigned
                            the task of holding charge of different areas to combat the communal tensions and to stall
                            the march of raiders, in case an invasion occurs. One such peace Brigade in which Somnath
                            Bira was also a leading member, was assigned the charge of the Doda-Bhaderwah area to calm
                            down the communal tensions that had erupted there. However, after successfully accomplishing
                            their duty, when the Brigade members were returning back to Srinagar, Bira was found
                            missing. It is believed that he was shot dead by the hostile forces near a place called
                            Reghi Nallah, somewhere between Doda and Bhaderwah. The exact location where his body fell
                            remained unknown even to his group members and unfortunately, the body of this young and
                            passionate martyr could never be recovered. The life of this young intellectual was silenced
                            while performing his patriotic duties in the service of the nation.<br><br>

                        <p>
                            Kedar Nath Sahni was born on 24 October 1926 at Thatta village of Rawalpindi. His father,
                            Keshav Das Sahni, was a squadron leader in the army. It was this army background that became
                            the primary source of his disciplined and courageous life.<br><br>

                            After completing his primary education, he came to Jammu in 1942 for further studies and
                            joined the Prince of Wales College (now GGM Science College) . It was during his stay at
                            Jammu that he met Sri Premnath Dogra, the chief organizer (Sangha Chalak) of the Rashtriya
                            Swayamsewak Sangha. Influenced by his ideology and working style, he joined the volunteer
                            group, and later, after completing his studies, he made Mirpur the core area of his
                            volunteer activities.<br><br>

                            At the time of partition, Sri Kedarnath Sahni was the district pracharak of Mirpur, a
                            district headquarters of the western part of Jammu province which was predominantly a Muslim
                            majority area. Hindus, who were less than ten percent of the population, constituted the
                            business community. It was a center of influential Mahajans who had trading relations with
                            Jammu.<br><br>

                            After ravaging Bhimber and Kotli- both the tehsil headquarters within the Mirpur district,
                            the Pakistani raiders reached this strategic town on 25th November 1947. Unfortunately,
                            after the fall of Bhimber and Kotli, Mirpur had been cut off from Jammu. The state garrison
                            stationed there had been running out of ammunition due to constant firing against the
                            raiders. Terror-stricken helpless civilians began to run in panic. However, hardly two
                            thousand people strugglingly managed to reach Jhanger safely while the rest were either
                            killed or taken away as captives. A number of women were abducted and sold in bazaars of
                            Peshawer and Rawalpindi. The repeated request and persuasion with the central authorities
                            for the reinforcement of the Indian army in Mirpur was turned down and was rather diverted
                            to Kashmir region due to the indifferent attitude of the state authorities towards these
                            areas.<br><br>

                            In the midst of the barbarity of the Pakistani army, the resonance of a ray of hope during
                            this seething turmoil could be seen in the commendable work of Sri Kedarnath Sahni and that
                            too, at that particular time, when the state troops and the officials lost heart and
                            retreated, leaving behind the helpless civilians at the mercy of the dreaded raiders. It was
                            no other than Kedarnath Sahni and his team of volunteers who saved the lives of thousands of
                            Hindus and Sikhs who were migrating to Jhanger in caravans from Mirpur and other adjoining
                            areas.<br><br>

                            During the time of the Pakistani tribal attack, Sri Kedarnath ji was at Sangh headquarters
                            at Deewana Mandir, Jammu. As soon as he got the news of the mass massacre of Hindus and
                            Sikhs in the district of Mirpur, Sahni Ji, with the help of some active volunteers including
                            Sri Gopal Dutt Mehangi, Sri Jagdish Abrol, and others immediately managed the humanitarian
                            aid and food (dal mixed chapattis) prepared in the houses of the local people and packed in
                            small bags for the migrating refugees. Around twenty-five lorries packed with this food,
                            bags proceeded towards Jhangar where the caravans of the people from Mirpur were advancing.
                            The Lorries reached safely to Jhangar where sangha sewaks distributed those dal mixed
                            chapattis to nearly 4,500 refugees from Mirpur and subsequently, helped these caravans to
                            reach Jammu safely where under the supervision of Sri Kedarnath Sahni, the people of Jammu
                            had made further arrangements for providing humanitarian aid to these refugees.<br><br>

                            His daunting task of saving the lives of helpless people of Mirpur and adjoining areas is a
                            remarkable example of his sense of duty towards his nation and his feelings of patriotism
                            which is inspirational. Later, he joined active politics and served the nation in various
                            capacities as Governor of Sikkim (2001-2002) and Governor of Goa (2002-2004).

                        <p>Shankarlal Dwarkadas Parikh was born at Kathlal of Kheda district on 4 June 1886. He attended
                            the session of the Indian National Congress held in 1910. As a representative of the Gujarat
                            Congress Provincial Committee, he also participated in the Bombay Provincial Conference at

                            where he served as the secretary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. Shankarlal was arrested during
                            the Salt Satyagraha in 1930 and was imprisoned at Sabarmati jail and later at Visapur jail.
                            He worked at the Kapadvanj Taluka Congress Committee, Kheda District Congress Committee,
                            Gujarat Provincial Congress Committee, and Kheda District Local Board. He was closely

                        <p>Ramakrishna Pillai was a great journalist in British Travancore who expressed great courage
                            to oppose British rule in Travancore, especially the oppressive rule of Diwan of Travancore.
                            He was born on 25 May 1878 at Neyyattinkara in Thiruvananthapuram. Immediately after his
                            school education, he became the editor of the newspaper Kerala Darpanam in 1900 from
                            Trivandrum. Later he became editor of Kerala Panchika and Malayali in 1903. Though he
                            started a magazine namely Keralan in 1905, it was stopped immediately due to various
                            reasons.<br><br>

                            He became very famous as the editor of the newspaper Swadeshabhimani in January 1906 at
                            Thiruvananthapuram. This newspaper was established by the prominent Muslim reformer Vakkom
                            Abdul Khader Moulavi. Because of his intimate connection with this newspaper, he came to be
                            known as ‘Swadeshabhimani Ramakrishna Pillai’. He severely criticized the corruption and
                            misrule of the British officers in Travancore. Through this newspaper, fearless Ramakrishna
                            Pillai even strongly opposed Diwan of Travancore P. Rajagopalachari.<br><br>

                            Due to his fearless journalism, the government arrested him and deported him to Tirunelveli
                            in Madras state from Travancore on 26th September 1910. The government banned the
                            Swadeshabhimani newspaper and the printing press was confiscated. Later in 1913, he reached
                            Palakkad in Malabar and wrote the book The Travancore Deportation. This book was a great
                            boost to the freedom movement of Kerala. He died on 28 March 1916.</p><br><br>

                            Perunchiththiranar was born on 10 March 1933 in Salem, Tamil Nadu to Duraiswamy and Mrs.
                            Kunjammal Duraiswamy. He wrote Tamil poems from his school days. He was an excellent poet,
                            later earning even the appreciation and applause of Bharathidasan. Perunchiththiranar's
                            commitment to independent Tamil Nadu was unswerving and constant. In 1972 he organized the
                            first Tamil Nadu Freedom Conference. So the government's tactic was to issue prohibitory
                            order against the meeting saying that it would "disturb the peace". People, however,
                            attended the conference in spite of the prohibitory order. Perunchiththiranar and some
                            others were arrested for violating the order and he spent a week in jail. He organized
                            similar conferences in 1973 and 1974 also. He participated in the "Tamil Nadu National
                            Self-Determination Conference" organized by the Tamil National Movement (TNM) (Tamil Desiya
                            Iyakkam) President P. Nedumaran in Thanjai in 1990. Perunchiththiranar himself was
                            imprisoned 8 times, spending a total of about 27 months in jail, for his various activities
                            relating to Tamil and social reform. He has the dubious honour of being imprisoned by the
                            Congress, DMK, and AIADMK governments of Tamil Nadu as well as when Tamil Nadu was under
                            governor's rule. Perunchiththiranar passed away at the age of 62 on 11 June 1995.</p>

                            Gandhi, founded the Indian National Army (INA) in 1943 with the support of the Japanese
                            during World War II to fight the British. She joined at the age of 21 years in INA. She
                            belonged to the Rani of Jhansi Regiment, the women's regiment of the INA. She was first sent

                        <p>Kartar Singh (1902-1974) was born on 22 February 1902 in the Chak No. 40 district of Lyallpur
                            (Faisalabad, now in Pakistan). His family was originally from Nagoke village in the Amritsar
                            district. Following the annexation of Punjab on March 29, 1849, the British government
                            established canal colonies in Lyallpur, and Kartar Singh's family migrated there. He
                            received his early education at the village gurudwara before enrolling in Khalsa School in
                            neighboring Chak No. 41, where he matriculated in 1921. He had a religious bent of mind and
                            during his school days, he led a kirtan jatha, or group of hymn singers, earning him the
                            moniker Giani (learned in religious texts). For further studies, he enrolled at Khalsa
                            College, Amritsar.<br><br>

                            The Jallianwala Bagh Massacre profoundly influenced him, and he became interested in
                            politics. When Michael O'Dwyer killed several innocent people in Amritsar, he was there.
                            This event, as well as the martial law conditions in Punjab under which he travelled from
                            Amritsar to his village, had a profound effect on his mind. In 1920, he and a group of
                            fellow students raised funds for Mahatma Gandhi's Tilak Swaraj Fund.<br><br>

                            Kartar Singh led a group of students to a Sikh conference in Dharowali village, near Dera
                            Baba Nanak, in early October 1920. Later on, Shiromani Akali Dal was founded as a Sikh
                            representative body on December 14, 1920. He was appointed general secretary of the
                            Shiromani Akali Dal's Lyallpur district unit in 1924. During the Jaito Morcha (February
                            1924), he was arrested for welcoming and serving langar to a Shaheedi Jatha (martyr's group)
                            on its way to Nabha to participate in the Morcha. He was sentenced to six months in the
                            Cambellpur Jail for this.<br><br>

                            In 1926, he was elected to the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee, which had been
                            reconstituted under the Sikh Gurdwaras Act of 1925. In October 1927, he became a member of
                            its executive committee. He led a protest against the Simon Commission's visit to India on
                            October 30, 1928, at the Lahore Railway Station, shouting "Simon, Go Back!" During the Civil
                            Disobedience Movement, he was arrested and sentenced to one year in prison for delivering
                            seditious speeches.<br><br>

                            Kartar Singh was elected to the executive committees of both the Shiromani Gurdwara
                            Parbandhak Committee and the Shiromani Akali Dal in 1933. He was elected to the Punjab
                            Legislative Assembly from the Lyallpur district in 1937. In 1943, Kartar Singh proposed his
                            Azad Punjab scheme in response to Pakistan's Muslim League demand. The scheme envisioned a
                            Punjab in which no single religious community held a sway. As a representative of Sikhs,
                            Master Tara Singh, Akali Stalwart, pursued this scheme in political negotiations with the
                            Congress, Muslim League, and British.<br><br>

                            Kartar Singh was elected president of the Shiromani Akali Dal in January 1947. On June 3,
                            1947, Viceroy Mountbatten declared the partition plan. During these turbulent days, Kartar
                            Singh, at great personal risk, assisted in the migration of Sikhs to India, particularly
                            from the districts of Lyallpur and Sheikhupura. On March 17, 1948, the Shiromani Akali Dal
                            working committee, led by him, passed a resolution allowing all Akali members of the East
                            Punjab Assembly to join the Congress. Kartar Singh joined the Congress and was appointed
                            Revenue Minister in the East Punjab government of Chief Minister Gopi Chand Bhargava. He
                            made his mark in rehabilitating the refugees from Pakistan. Here, he was ably assisted by
                            Dr. M. S. Randhawa.</p>

                        <p>Kanailal Datta(1888-1908), son of Chunilal Datta, was born in Chandannagore in the Hooghly
                            district of West Bengal. He had his early education in Dupleix Vidyamandir followed by his
                            BA degree from Muhammad Mohasin College, Hooghly.<br><br>

                            A French colony, Chandannagore was at that time a safe shelter and a happy recruiting center
                            for revolutionaries. Kanailal had his arms training as a school student. After his BA
                            examination (April 1908), he secured a revolver from Matilal Roy of the Prabartak Samgha and
                            shifted to Calcutta. He was initially shortlisted for the Muzaffarpur event but was later
                            engaged in making bombs at Yugantar’s Gopimohan Datta Lane hideout. As a fallout of the
                            Manicktala Bomb Case, he was arrested on 2 May 1908 and sent to the Alipore Central
                            Jail.<br><br>

                            Meanwhile, a fellow revolutionary turned approver, Naren Gosain confessed that everything,
                            from Muzaffarpur to Alipore, was designed by Aurobindo Ghosh; leaders decided to eliminate
                            him prior to his submission to the court. Kanailal and another jail mate Satyendranath Bose
                            were chosen for the job. The way they accomplished it, to borrow Matilal Roy, was a unique
                            tale of heroism, dare-devilry, and unmitigated sacrifice for the motherland. Both of them
                            were sentenced to death.<br><br>

                            Later, when the British Magistrate asked Kanailal, a boy of twenty years, about his crime;
                            he replied, ‘I have killed a traitor.’ Magistrate repeated, ‘Do you want to appeal?’ He
                            rebutted ‘No, there shall be no appeal.’ On 10 November 1908, Kanailal was hanged to death
                            inside the jail in the early morning; the same day Calcutta witnessed one of its longest
                            processions in history, with his mortal remains.</p>
